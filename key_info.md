#RStudio and R installation
R and RStudio are separate downloads and installations. R is the underlying statistical computing environment, but using R alone is no fun. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you install RStudio.

## Windows
### If you already have R and RStudio installed
 - Download R from the [CRAN website](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm).
 - Click on and run the .exe file that was just downloaded. Leave all default settings in the installation options.
 - Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) 
 - Under Installers select RStudio x.yy.zzz - Windows XP/Vista/7/8 (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
 - Double click the file to install it
 - Once it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages


## macOS
### If you already have R and RStudio installed
 - Download R from the [CRAN website](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx).
 - Click on and run the .exe file that was just downloaded. Leave all default settings in the installation options.
 - Under Installers select RStudio x.yy.zzz - Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit) (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
 - Double click the file to install it
 - Once it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages
