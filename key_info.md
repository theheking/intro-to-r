# RStudio and R installation
R and RStudio are separate downloads and installations. R is the underlying statistical computing environment, but using R alone is no fun. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you install RStudio. Please choose the operating system (OS) that you use.


## Garvan Owned Devices 
If anyone has a Garvan-owned Windows device and requires any software installed, they need to contact ithelp@garvan.org.au to get it done (as they might not have administrator privileges) and if they have Garvan-owned MacBook, they can install any software by themselves
